excerpt: 'ABSTRACT: Using quasi-experimental variations in college students’ exposure to Facebook, I document the unintended consequences of communication technology on student loan borrowing behavior. My estimates show that the rollout of Facebook at a college reduces the number of student loan recipients by 7.965%, equivalent to approximately 215 fewer recipients based on the sample mean. Meanwhile, I find consistent declines in both the number and dollar amount of disbursements. I provide evidence that these effects are due to improvements in students’ financial situation through part-time job search. Further analysis reveals treatment effect heterogeneity based on racial minorities, ex-ante human capital investment, and rent-seeking behavior at private for-profit institutions, suggesting the reallocation of student debt resources. Taken together, communication technology can reduce students’ reliance on student loans by enhancing their job search efficiency. My findings provide insights into the demand-side determinants of student loan borrowing and show how the diffusion of communication technology influences the allocation of public resources, informing policy considerations at the federal level.'
