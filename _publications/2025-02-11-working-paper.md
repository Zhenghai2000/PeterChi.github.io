excerpt: 'ABSTRACT: Using quasi-experimental variations in college students’ exposure to Facebook, I document the unintended consequences of communication technology on student loan borrowing behavior. My estimates show that the rollout of Facebook at a college reduces the number of student loan recipients by 7.965%, equivalent to approximately 215 fewer recipients based on the sample mean. I also find consistent declines in both the number and dollar amount of disbursements. Utilizing the variations in state minimum wage and college location, I provide evidence that these effects are driven by improved part-time job search efficiency. Further analysis suggests the reallocation of student loans in the context of Facebook, associated with racial minority status, ex-ante human capital investment, and the rent-seeking behavior of private for-profit institutions. Taken together, the findings indicate that communication technology can reduce students’ reliance on student loans by enhancing labor market engagement. This study offers insights into the demand-side determinants of student loan borrowing and reveals how the diffusion of digital platforms influences the allocation of debt resources, informing policy considerations.'
