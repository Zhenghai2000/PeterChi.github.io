Open data and sharing are cornerstones of academic advancement. I share some datasets I found interesting here and hope they prove useful for others. Feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss further!

{% include base_path %}
  {% capture written_year %}'None'{% endcapture %}
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    {% capture year %}{{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}{% endcapture %}
    {% if year != written_year %}
      <h2 id="{{ year | slugify }}" class="archive__subtitle">{{ year }}</h2>
      {% capture written_year %}{{ year }}{% endcapture %}
  {% endif %}
  {% include archive-single.html %}
{% endfor %}
