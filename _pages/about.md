Hi, welcome to my website!

I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the [Deparment of Accounting](https://bschool.nus.edu.sg/accounting/), [NUS Business School](https://bschool.nus.edu.sg/).

Before starting my Ph.D. at [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://www.nus.edu.sg/), I received my B.B.A. in Business Analytics (BA) from [Macau University of Science and Technology (MUST)](https://www.must.edu.mo/index.html?locale=en_US).
