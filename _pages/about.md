Hi, welcome to my website!

I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the [Deparment of Accounting](https://bschool.nus.edu.sg/accounting/), NUS Business School.

Before starting my Ph.D. at [National University of Singapore (NUS)](https://www.nus.edu.sg/), I received my B.B.A. in Business Analytics (BA) from [Macau University of Science and Technology (MUST)](https://www.must.edu.mo/index.html?locale=en_US). You can download my CV [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/jx3zq9trq59hxo4s6z7aj/Peter_CV.pdf?rlkey=hvn98dien328136313v15d1dh&dl=0).

I employ econometric and machine learning methods to investigate topics at the intersection of Accounting and Finance. My research primarily focuses on **information in digital spaces**, with an emphasis on **informal and non-traditional channels** such as social media, online forums, and other user-generated content platforms. 

One strand of my research explores **misinformation in digital spaces**. I highlight the role of government regulators in governing market information and examine whether regulatory interventions can effectively curtail misinformation and enhance the efficiency of information intermediaries in capital markets. This contributes to our understanding of how information flows evolve in the digital age, and how such landscape-shifting changes reshape firmsâ€™ information environment, market efficiency, and regulation. 

Another area of my research investigates the **real effects** of information technology *per se* and digital information. In the spirit of Social Economics, I examine how social media facilitates information acquisition through social networks, thereby influencing individual loan borrowing behavior. This line of research underscores that the impact of digital spaces is not confined to virtual interactions; rather, it extends to real-world economic decisions and outcomes. By lowering information acquisition costs, digital platforms affect financial behaviors and ultimately, the allocation of economic resources.
