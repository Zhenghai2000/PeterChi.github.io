Designed for the Assistant Professors in Accounting, the Tri-Uni Accounting Research Conference was first introduced in April 2012, with the intent of promoting Assistant Professorsâ€™ research; fostering collaborations among junior and senior faculty; giving Assistant Professors a chance of exchanging ideas; and finally, presenting their work to peers and senior faculty.

The Tri-Uni Accounting Research Conference is hosted alternately among the three universities - National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University, and Singapore Management University.
