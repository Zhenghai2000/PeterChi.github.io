The organising committee of this small informal workshop invites submissions of high-quality theoretical and empirical research on financial intermediation. Scholars in the fields of banking and finance will meet to discuss current issues in banking, financial stability, bank regulation, financial innovation, financial inclusion, and consumer credit. The workshop provides an opportunity for discussions about policy-relevant research in an informal and interactive environment. 

The event is co-sponsored by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, whose generosity is gratefully acknowledged.
