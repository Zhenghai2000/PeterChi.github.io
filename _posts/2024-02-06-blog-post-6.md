This dataset provides daily estimates of (i) minimum temperature, (ii) maximum temperature, and (iii) precipitation. There is one pipped files per year. Within each year, there is a separate file for each county identified by the FIPS code (5 digits, the first two are state FIPS, the last three are county FIPS).

The data is based on the PRISM dataset but keeps the set of weather stations constant over time. Weather stations were identified based on nonmissing data from 1950 to 2018 (hence version 2018), and missing data were cross-interpolated using surrounding stations. The dataset uses the same spatial resolution as the original PRISM data (1/24 degree in both latitude and longitude). The PRISM grids are assigned to the county in which the grid centroid is located.
