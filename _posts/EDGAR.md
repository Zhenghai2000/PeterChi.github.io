The EDGAR system began with an SEC announcement in 1993, mandating that all SEC-registered firms submit their filings electronically. This was to be implemented in 10 waves over three years. Initially, the SEC intended to limit access to these electronic filings to terminals located in their reference rooms, which wouldn't have significantly changed the accessibility or associated costs for most investors.

However, the landscape changed dramatically when the National Science Foundation decided to support a project that would make these filings freely available online. This began on January 17, 1994, with the filings of the firms in the first four phase-in waves of EDGAR, made accessible online through NYU's system. The subsequent six waves continued to make current and historic filings universally accessible online.
