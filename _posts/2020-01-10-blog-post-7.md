This API is the primary place to obtain row-level data from the EPA's Air Quality System (AQS) database. If you would like aggregated or visual data from AQS, or large files of pre-extracted data, AirData is the place to start.

AQS contains ambient air sample data collected by state, local, tribal, and federal air pollution control agencies from thousands of monitors around the nation. It also contains meteorological data, descriptive information about each monitoring station (including its geographic location and its operator), and information about the quality of the samples. More about AQS. Note, AQS does not contain real-time air quality data (it can take 6 months or more from the time data is collected until it is in AQS). For real-time data, please visit the [AirNow API](https://docs.airnowapi.org/).
