Indiegogo and Kickstarter are two of the worldâ€™s leading crowdfunding platforms, launched in 2008 and 2009 respectively. These platforms allow entrepreneurs, artists, and innovators to raise funds for creative, technological, and social impact projects directly from the public. 

Indiegogo supports both fixed and flexible funding models and allows for a wider range of campaign types, including charitable and product-related projects. Kickstarter, on the other hand, uses an all-or-nothing funding model and primarily focuses on creative projects such as design, games, film, and technology.
